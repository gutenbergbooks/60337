<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">You</span> go down shade to the river, where naked men sit on flat brown rocks, to watch the ferry, in the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you cross the ferry with the naked people, go up the tropical lane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the palm-trees and past hollow paddy-fields where naked men are threshing rice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the monolithic water-buffaloes, like old, muddy stones with hair on them, are being idle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the shadow of bread-fruit trees, with their dark green, glossy, fanged leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Very handsome, and some pure yellow fanged leaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out into the open, where the path runs on the top of a dyke between paddy-fields:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, of course, you meet a huge and mud-grey elephant advancing his frontal bone, his trunk curled round a log of wood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So you step down the bank, to make way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shuffle, shuffle, and his little wicked eye has seen you as he advances above you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slow beast curiously spreading his round feet for the dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the slim naked man slips down, and the beast deposits the lump of wood, carefully.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The keeper hooks the vast knee, the creature salaams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">White man, you are saluted.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the best is the Pera-hera, at midnight, under the tropical stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a pale little wisp of a Prince of Wales, diffident, up in a small pagoda on the temple side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white people in evening dress buzzing and crowding the stand upon the grass below and opposite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at last the Pera-hera procession, flambeaux aloft in the tropical night, of blazing cocoa-nut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked dark men beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the huge frontal of three great elephants stepping forth to the tom-tom’s beat, in the torch-light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly sailing in gorgeous apparel through the flame-light, in front of a towering, grimacing white image of wood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The elephant bells striking slow, tong-tong, tong-tong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To music and queer chanting:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enormous shadow-processions filing on in the flare of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the fume of cocoa-nut oil, in the sweating tropical night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the noise of the tom-toms and singers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elephants after elephants curl their trunks, vast shadows, and some cry out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they approach and salaam, under the dripping fire of the torches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pale fragment of a Prince up there, whose motto is <i>Ich dien</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pale, dispirited Prince, with his chin on his hands, his nerves tired out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching and hardly seeing the trunk-curl approach and clumsy, knee-lifting salaam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the hugest, oldest of beasts in the night and the fire-flare below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is royalty, pale and dejected fragment up aloft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down below huge homage of shadowy beasts; barefoot and trunk-lipped in the night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Chieftains, three of them abreast, on foot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strut like peg-tops, wound around with hundreds of yards of fine linen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They glimmer with tissue of gold, and golden threads on a jacket of velvet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their faces are dark, and fat, and important.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They are royalty, dark-faced royalty, showing the conscious whites of their eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stepping in homage, stubborn, to that nervous pale lad up there.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">More elephants, tong, tong-tong, loom up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge, more tassels swinging, more dripping fire of new cocoa-nut cressets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High, high flambeaux, smoking of the east;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarlet hot embers of torches knocked out of the sockets among bare feet of elephants and men on the path in the dark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And devil dancers luminous with sweat, dancing on to the shudder of drums,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tom-toms, weird music of the devil, voices of men from the jungle singing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endless, under the Prince.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Towards the tail of the everlasting procession<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the long hot night, mere dancers from insignificant villages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smaller, more frightened elephants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men-peasants from jungle villages dancing and running with sweat and laughing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked dark men with ornaments on, on their naked arms and their naked breasts, the grooved loins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming like metal with running sweat as they suddenly turn, feet apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dance, and dance, forever dance, with breath half sobbing in dark, sweat-shining breasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lustrous great tropical eyes unveiled now, gleaming a kind of laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A naked, gleaming dark laugh, like a secret out in the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flare of a tropical energy, tireless, afire in the dark, slim limbs and breasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetual, fire-laughing motion, among the slow shuffle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of elephants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hot dark blood of itself a-laughing, wet, half-devilish, men all motion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching under that small pavilion, and tropical eyes dilated look up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inevitably look up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Prince<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that tired remnant of royalty up there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose motto is <i>Ich dien</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As if the homage of the kindled blood of the east<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went up in wavelets to him, from the breasts and eyes of jungle torch-men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he couldn’t take it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What would they do, those jungle men running with sweat, with the strange dark laugh in their eyes, glancing up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sparse-haired elephants slowly following,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they knew that his motto was <i>Ich dien</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that he meant it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They begin to understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rickshaw boys begin to understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the devil comes into their faces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a different sort, a cold, rebellious, jeering devil.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In elephants and the east are two devils, in all men maybe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery of the dark mountain of blood, reeking in homage, in lust, in rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passive with everlasting patience,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the little, cunning pig-devil of the elephant’s lurking eyes, the unbeliever.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We dodged, when the Pera-hera was finished, under the hanging, hairy pigs’ tails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the flat, flaccid mountains of the elephants’ standing haunches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vast-blooded beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself so little dodging rather scared against the eternal wrinkled pillars of their legs, as they were being dismantled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I knew they were dejected, having come to hear the repeated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Royal summons: <i>Dient Ihr!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Serve!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Serve, vast mountainous blood, in submission and splendour, serve royalty.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of which, the silent, fatal emission from that pale, shattered boy up there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ich dien.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That’s why the night fell in frustration.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That’s why, as the elephants ponderously, with unseeming swiftness, galloped uphill in the night, going back to the jungle villages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the elephant bells sounded tong-tong-tong, bell of the temple of blood in the night, swift-striking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the crowd like a field of rice in the dark gave way like liquid to the dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looming gallop of the beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was as if the great bare bulks of elephants in the obscure light went over the hill-brow swiftly, with their tails between their legs, in haste to get away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bells sounding frustrate and sinister.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all the dark-faced, cotton-wrapped people, more numerous and whispering than grains of rice in a ricefield at night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the dark-faced, cotton-wrapped people, a countless host on the shores of the lake, like thick wild rice by the water’s edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting for the fireworks of the after-show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the rockets went up, and the glare passed over countless faces, dark as black rice growing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showing a glint of teeth, and glancing tropical eyes aroused in the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was the faintest twist of mockery in every face, across the hiss of wonders as the rocket burst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High, high up, in flakes, shimmering flakes of blue fire, above the palm-trees of the islet in the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O faces upturned to the glare, O tropical wonder, wonder, a miracle in heaven!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shadow of a jeer, of underneath disappointment, as the rocket-coruscation died, and shadow was the same as before.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They were foiled, the myriad whispering dark-faced cotton-wrapped people.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had come to see royalty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bow before royalty, in the land of elephants, bow deep, bow deep.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On the roof of the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bit awkward, and with a funny squawk in his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mother Liberty trying always to teach him to coo<br /></span>
